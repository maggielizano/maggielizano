Hi there! I'm a self-taught Business Analyst from **Costa Rica** working at **Amazon** 🇨🇷  

Obsessed with process improvement & automation, if I can make it faster or smarter, I will 💁🏻‍♀️✨

- Currently diving into **Python** 🐍, **Cloud** ☁️, **AI** 🤖, and **Prompt Engineering**
- Learning by doing, failing, Googling, and trying again, repeat loop included ♻️
- Let’s build cool stuff and break things (intentionally... mostly)

Always up for learning something new. Feel free to connect!
